Dear Mr Dorey,

I'm excited to be applying for the Software Development Engineer position at Amazon. As someone who is highly focused and attentive to detail, I thrive on building quality systems that surpass end users' expectations. I'm thrilled at the opportunity to show off my technical expertise and leadership skills as part of Amazon's expert team.

During my previous role at Crane & Jenkins, I was charged with developing innovative solutions across a variety of software platforms. I was instrumental in developing mobile-ready expense tracking software for our fast-growing portfolio of real estate clients. In 2016, I led the development of a proprietary document management system and was responsible for the successful migration of all client content from our legacy system to the new platform.

I am also attentive to the need for continued process improvements. When we faced repeated deadline delays due to Quality Assurance challenges, I proposed and carried out the implementation of an automated bug tracking system to identify potential issues earlier in the development cycle. This resulted in an average of 43% fewer defects reported during late-stage QA reviews and a 32% reduction in days between project kickoff and production launch.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I'm looking forward to learning more details about the Software Development Engineer position at Amazon. I'm excited about the opportunity to leverage my unique range of skills, and I'm eager to demonstrate my commitment to developing world-class software solutions for Amazon.

Sincerely,

Ebony Moore

Dear Ms Oheriner,

I am delighted to apply for the Accountanting Analyst position at Scotiabank. The opportunity to potentially work for your company, which has been recognized as the quickest-growing operator in the field of civil engineering, excites me as I continue to seek new accounting challenges. As someone who has spent multiple years in public practice, I possess an in-depth understanding of the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) as well as the basics of internal auditing. I believe that my knowledge would match this job opening very well.

During my previous roles with companies such as Crossover Software and Foundry Marketing, I worked as an accountant to the CFO and lead internal auditor, respectively. These experiences gave me an outstanding perspective on the fruitful implementation of new accounting software and consistent adherence to the rapidly evolving laws of business. I also developed outstanding communication skills that let me work with practically anyone and helped me coordinate dozens of projects that had a 95% combined rate of timely completion.

I would also like to stress my ability to support accounting seniors by completing all of the delegated tasks effectively. With over 400 hours of continuing education, I have an excellent understanding of potential areas of practice where businesses may face issues. This allowed me to identify and proactively resolve countless issues that reduced my prior employer's need to halt accounting operations by 45%. I further thrive in public speaking engagements organized at professional workplace settings.

I am grateful for the opportunity to receive your consideration for the Accounting Analyst position. Thank you for the time spent reviewing my application. I look forward to any subsequent interaction where I will be more than happy to discuss the specific nature of my prior experiences in more detail. I hope to become a part of the Scotiabank's team and join the effort to rebuild communities in a sustainable manner.

Dear Mr. Mantell,

Having worked as a network engineer at Sansong for the past five years, I understand the varied requirements of the role at Apple. My previous experience in infrastructure design will also assist in the considerable project-led aspects of the position.

My computer science degree from CalTech was followed up with a year of international work experience at the Tokyo Tech Conference. I embarked on my Cisco certifications soon after beginning my first role and I have been on a journey of continuous improvement since.

I have been a keen participant in security hackathons over the past five years and it was my team mate Sarah Jenwith who alerted me to the role at Apple. We came second in a recent State competition, and she told me much about the challenges that you are currently facing. My network optimization work at Sansong reduced security issues by 35% over a two-year period and my encryption protocols received company-wide recognition. In terms of my technical expertise, I have experience in the following:

LAN, VPN, SAN and VoIP infrastructure design
Network and security admin, design, analysis and improvement
Cloud computing systems with encrypted data storage facilities
 
My network support decreased downtime for my department by 7% and we improved malware detection by 45%. This resulted in an estimated business saving of $2.5m and is something that I know I can replicate at Apple.

I would welcome the opportunity of an interview to find out more about the challenges and specifics of the role.

Sincerely,
Wilma Dean
